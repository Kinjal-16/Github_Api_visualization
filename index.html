        <h3>1. Branches in the repositories</h3>
        <br/>
        <h4>
                The graphs given below shows the number of branches, a repository in an organization have.
                <br/>
                The graph in Fig 1 shows the repositories with the lowest number of branches(max 40 displayed)
                in the organization.
                <br/>
                On the other hand, the graph in Fig 2 shows the  repositories with the highest number of branches(max 40 displayed)
                in the organization.

        <h3>2. Pull Request Size</h3>
        <h4>
            The graphs given below compares the overall pull request sizes made for a repository of an organization.
            <br/>
            This metric is significant because the team making the pull request must ensure that the pull request size is small enough so 
            that the reviewerâ€™s ability to detect defective code is maximized. Therefore, the repositories with highest percentages of 
            overall pull request size is show in the fig 3 whereas the repositories with lowest percentages of overall pull request size 
            is show in the fig 4.
            <br/>
            This is calculated by the taking the mean of the percentage change in the head repo size from its corresponding 
            base repo size over the pull requests made to each repository.
