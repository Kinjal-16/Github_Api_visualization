        <h3>1. Branches in the repositories</h3>
        <br/>
        <h4>
                The graphs given below shows the number of branches, a repository in an organization have.
                <br/>
                The graph in Fig 1 shows the repositories with the lowest number of branches(max 40 displayed)
                in the organization.
                <br/>
                On the other hand, the graph in Fig 2 shows the  repositories with the highest number of branches(max 40 displayed)
                in the organization.

        <h3>2. Pull Request Size</h3>
        <h4>
            The graphs shown below compares the overall pull request sizes in the repositories of an organization.
            The repositories with the highest percentages of overall pull request size is shown in fig 3 and
            the repositories with the lowest percentages of overall pull request size
            is show in fig 4.
            <br/>
            The team making the pull request must ensure that the pull request size is small enough so that the
            reviewerâ€™s ability to detect defective code is maximized. That is why pull request size is considered to be
            an important metric to judge the productivity of a software engineering team.
            <br/>
            Here, the overall pull request size is calculated by taking the mean of the percentage change in the
            head repo size from its corresponding base repo size over the number of pull requests made to each repository.
